3. Otherwise, you can select from a template:
    - Click on the button with the **caret icon** next to the button **+ Page**.
    - In the menu that dropped in, select among four different templates.

## Deleting a page

1. Select the page you want to delete.
2. Click on the button with the **caret icon** next to the button **+ Page** located on the left hand side of the screen.
3. Click on **Delete page** at the bottom of the menu.

## Duplicating a page

1. Select the page you want to duplicate.
2. Click on the button with the **caret icon** next to the button **+ Page** located on the left hand side of the screen.
