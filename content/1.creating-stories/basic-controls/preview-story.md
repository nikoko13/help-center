# Previewing your story

While you create your story, it's a good idea to preview your work so that you'll know what the story will look like and if your code function as expected.

1. In the studio, at the top of the screen, click **Preview**. Your story starts playing from the active page you were on.

2.  While previewing, you can:
    - Click the <v-icon icon="mdi-magnify"></v-icon> button to enter the **inspect mode**. This will help you to debug seeing what your code does.
    - Click the <v-icon icon="mdi-fullscreen"></v-icon> button to toggle **fullscreen mode**.

3. Once you are done, simply click the <v-icon icon="mdi-close"></v-icon> orange button to exit the preview mode.
