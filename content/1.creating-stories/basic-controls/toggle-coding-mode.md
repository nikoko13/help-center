# Switch to the coding side

Elementari uses a node-based visual coding environment. Each page of your story has a back side called the **Event Graph** where you can code by connecting blocks together.

<v-alert dense type="info" variant="outlined">
    You can leave the coding side by clicking on the white button <b>Layout Design</b>. This will take you back to the front side of the page where you can continue to write and design your story.
</v-alert>

1. Select the page you want to code.
2. Find the blue button **Event Graph** on the top fo the page.
3. Click on the button **Event Graph** to flip the page to the back side.
