# Using logic and conditions blocks

The logic and conditions blocks are used to compare variables and values, do calculations with numbers, and work with strings (text).

### Logic blocks

Elementari integrates two types:
- AND Gate
- OR Gate

The **AND** and **OR** operators are used to combine conditions. They are blocks that implement Boolean functions. In other words, they activate their output depending on which of the inputs (often called A and B) are active, if any.

On Elementari, An input is considered active if it is being sent the value is set to **true**.

To keep it simple:
- AND gate's output is active when **both** inputs are active.
- OR gate's output is active when **either** inputs are active.

### Conditions Blocks

 A conditional statement, also known as If/Then statement, tells a program to perform different actions depending on whether a condition is True or False. On Elementari, branching conditionals (If/then/else) are white blocks found in the Logic tab. Conditionals include **"Branch"**, **"Compare Text"**, **"Compare Numbers"**, and the condition port.
