# Using variables

You can create variables to **store** a value and are **shared** across every page.  These are useful to make your stories more dynamic and interactive for the readers ! In Elementari, we use 3 types of variables:

- Text
- Number
- Boolean (true or false)

### Adding a create variable block

1. Click on the **Event Graph** button at the top of the screen to go to the coding side.
2. Click on the **Variables** tab on the right hand side and add one of the following **blocks**:
    - Create Text Variables
    - Create Number Variables
    - Create Boolean Variables

### Creating a variable

Once you added a create variable block, click on the **+ New Variable** button.

An unique default name will be assigned to your variable.

### Renaming a variable

Sometimes you think of a better name for a variable.

Simply click on your variable's name to edit it.

The name must not contain any special characters nor spaces.

### Deleting a variable

To delete a variable, click on the **bin icon** located next to the variable's name.
