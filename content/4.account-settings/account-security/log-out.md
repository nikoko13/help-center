# How to log out of your account

Logging out of Elementari does not delete your account or your stories. You can always log back in later by using the **Log in** button.
It's recommended to log yourself out when you are done using Elementari, especially on shared devices.

1. Click on your **profile picture** located at the top right of the screen.
2. In the drop down menu, click **Logout** to simply end your session.
