# How to protect your account

## Use unique, strong passwords

Using the same password on multiple sites exposes you to serious threats. If someone figures out your password for one website, that person could access the entirety of your accounts on the internet.

**Meet password requirements**

Your password can be any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols (ASCII-standard characters only). Accents and accented characters aren't supported.

You can't use a password that:

- Is particularly weak. Example: "password123"
- You've used before on your account
- Starts or ends with a blank space

## Do not communicate sensitive data

Elementari allows you to communicate with other users through:

- live chat room while creating stories together
- comments under published stories

These are can be accessed publicly. Do not share any personal pieces of information tht could expose your identity such as:

- Home address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Password
- Name
- School Name

## Update your software

If your browser or operating system are out-of-date, the software might not be safe from hackers. Keep your software updated to help protect your account.
