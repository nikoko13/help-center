# What is webmonetization?

Web monetization currently works by transferring micropayments from a website visitor's web monetization subscription to the monetized site or digital asset they spend time on.

## Why it matters

Web Monetization is one of the solutions that people are working on to make the web more equitable for creatives and solve some of the problems such as pushing more and more advertising to the point of hurting the user experience.

## How it works

Web Monetization is one way of changing this by streaming micropayments to the digital content creators whose content you spend time with on the web, helping to remunerate those content creators for their time and expenses, and allowing them to earn without invasive advertising. 

## About Coil

Elementari has chosen to use the [Coil Ecosystem](https://coil.com/about) to implement this functionality as it is an open source technology and offers the flexibility we need to better reward creators' content.

## How to monetize your content on Elementari


Elementari is monetizing two types of content:

- Published stories
- Published Curriculums

Please read to this [article](https://help.elementari.com/account-settings/elementari-contributors/about-creator-program) for further details.

## How you can support creators

By purchasing a [Coil subscription](https://coil.com/) ($5 US per month) and adding the Coil extension to your browser and Puma Browser app to your mobile device, Coil will stream micropayments from your subscription to Elementari content creators each month.
