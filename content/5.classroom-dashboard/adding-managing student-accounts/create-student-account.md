# Create Student Accounts

You can add students to your classroom in three ways:

### Manually creating a student account

You can create student accounts to add to your classroom at any time. Simply choose a username. If you do enter in an email address, an email from Elementari will be automatically sent to the student with the log in details.

When creating a classroom, you can choose to "Set Password for Students". This will set the password to be the same for all student accounts created (recommended for younger students). Otherwise, a temporary password (your class code) will be set as the password for students. Students will log in with the temporary password, and then set their own password.

### Having students sign up and connect to your classroom with a class code
Students can individually sign up for their own student account. They can manually sign up or use Single Sign On (SSO) with google.

    Make sure students are signing up <b> with your class code </b>. Otherwise, they will be creating a regular account and will need to connect to your classroom from their Account Settings. See My students have an account, but are not in my classroom.

They will need to use your class code to connect to your classroom. You can find your class code in your classroom dashboard.

### Importing all your students in your classroom via google classroom
Student accounts are automatically created and added to your classroom when choosing to import from a google classroom. If a student already has an account (with the same email as the one in google classroom), then that student will be added to your classroom.

If new students join your google classroom, you can synce your student accounts by re-importing the same clasroom.

See the section on Importing Google Clasroom for more details.
