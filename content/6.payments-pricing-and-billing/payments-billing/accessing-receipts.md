# Accessing receipts

You will receive an receipt as soonas we've processed your purchase. It will come from Elementari, LLC and will be an automatically generated email from stripe.com (the platform we use for secure playment processing). 

You can also view your subscription at any time when logged into Elementari. To download and view previous receipts: 
1. Click on the avatar in the top right corner.
2. Click on *Settings*. 
3. Select the *Plan* tab to view your current subscription and the list of receipts.
