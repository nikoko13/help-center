# Why did my subscription automatically renew?

Elementari Educator and Elementari Educator Plus plans automatically renew when your selected billing period ends (monthly or yearly). 

To prevent automatic renewal, you can cancel or pause your plan before your last paid period ends. You will still maintain access to premium features until the end of the paid period.

You will receive an automatic email 7 days prior to remind you of your renewal from stripe.com (the platform we use for secure playment processing).
